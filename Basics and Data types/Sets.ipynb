    "### How Python Sets are Stored in Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python sets are implemented as **hash tables**, similar to dictionaries but only store keys without values.\n",
    "- Internally, a set maintains an array of **buckets**, where each bucket stores a reference to an object or is empty.\n",
    "- Sets use a **dynamic allocation strategy** — they allocate extra space to reduce collisions and maintain fast membership tests.\n",
    "- This means an empty set already has a significant overhead due to preallocated buckets and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Overhead of Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- An empty set typically uses about **216 bytes** of memory just for the data structure allocation and metadata.\n",
    "- When elements are added, Python dynamically allocates more space, often resizing the internal hash table and increasing memory usage in larger chunks rather than per element.\n",
    "- Memory grows more when a set becomes fuller, as Python needs to maintain a load factor to keep operations efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Size Dependence on Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "- The size of a set object itself depends on the number of buckets allocated, **not directly on the size of elements**.\n",
    "- Each bucket stores a pointer/reference to a Python object.\n",
    "- The actual size of objects inside the set (e.g., integers, strings) is separate and depends on those objects themselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Buckets in Python Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python sets are implemented as **hash tables**, where elements are placed into \"buckets\" based on their hash values.\n",
    "- The number of buckets is important since it determines how many elements can be stored before Python needs to resize and rehash the set to reduce collisions and maintain performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Bucket Count Is Determined\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's hash table (including sets) maintains a **load factor**, which is the ratio of the number of stored elements to the number of buckets.\n",
    "- Typically Python keeps the load factor under **2/3** (approximately 0.66).\n",
    "- When the number of elements grows such that the load factor exceeds this threshold, Python resizes the hash table by increasing the number of buckets (usually doubling it), and rehashes all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Find the Number of Buckets for a Set\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct access to the bucket count is not exposed in the Python standard library.**\n",
    "- However, in CPython, the number of buckets correlates with the size returned by `sys.getsizeof()` and how close the set is to its load factor threshold.\n",
    "- Experimentally, you can infer the approximate bucket count by observing the size and growth behavior of sets as elements are added.\n"
