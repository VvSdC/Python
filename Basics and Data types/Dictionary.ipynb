    "### How Python Dictionaries Work Internally\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python dictionaries are **implemented as hash tables** that store **key-value pairs**.\n",
    "- Internally, dictionaries maintain an array of **buckets**, each capable of holding one key-value entry.\n",
    "- Initially, a dictionary starts with a small number of buckets (usually 8), and it **dynamically resizes (doubles the number of buckets)** as more entries are added to maintain efficient lookup speeds.\n",
    "- This resizing is triggered when the dictionary **load factor** (roughly the ratio of filled buckets to total buckets) exceeds a threshold, typically around 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Overhead of Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- An empty dictionary has significant overhead due to preallocated buckets and metadata, typically around **240 bytes** on 64-bit systems.\n",
    "- Adding key-value pairs does **not immediately increase** the dictionary's memory size until it hits the load threshold.\n",
    "- The size of the dictionary object reported by `sys.getsizeof()` reflects the space taken by the hash table itself (buckets and pointers), **not the size of the keys or values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keys and Values Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keys and values themselves are Python objects; their memory is **separately allocated**.\n",
    "- The dictionary stores only **references** (pointers) to these objects.\n",
    "- The actual memory footprint is the sum of the dictionary structure size plus the memory used by keys and values.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python dictionaries use a **dynamic hash table with open addressing** for storing keys and values.\n",
    "- Memory size grows primarily with the number of buckets, which is adjusted based on load factor to ensure performance.\n",
    "- The space taken by the dictionary structure is independent of the size of the keys and values, which are stored as separate objects.\n",
    "- Understanding this helps in memory profiling and efficient use of dictionaries in large-scale applications.\n",
